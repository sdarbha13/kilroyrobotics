  <h2>What Is It?</h2>

  <p class="quote">
  According to the dictionary, malware is a software intended to damage a computer, mobile device, computer system, or computer network, or to take partial control over its operation.
  </p>

  <p>Malware is the most popular form of hacking. There are many types of malware including: bugs, ransomware, adware, DoS and DDoS, and many more. All malware has one goal, to hurt the user. Most malware physically damage the computer such as bugs and DoS's. Others can harm the user itself such as ransomware and spyware. Most of these attacks occur through infected websites, programs, or emails. User error can unleash malware onto their device, therefore it is advised to take all the safety precautions.</p>

  <h2>Specifics</h2>

  <p class="quote">
This section will cover the three types of malware: viruses, worms, and trojans. </p>

  <p>Viruses get their name due to the similarities they possess with a human virus. First, they require a host to start off of. This would most likely be an infected download or program. There, it will infect the computer's files and can potentially shut down the computer. After performing it's job, it will then spread to other computers like a human virus. </p>

  <p>Worms can also replicate themselves to infect multiple computers. Unlike viruses, they don't require a host and can gain access mainly via email. Worms mainly harm entire networks, rather than computers. By doing so, they infect multiple computers at a time and they can also open backdoors for other malware.</p>

  <p>Trojans get their name after the wooden horse that was used to invade Troy. Similar to the horse, the hacker disguises the malware as a beneficial company and tricks the user to download their malware. Trojans are sent through email attahments and internet downloads. Trojan malware is similar to phishing, detailed in the next webpage. </p>

<p>71% of hacker attacks were trojan attacks due to their ability to manipulate the user. This can lead to an easy access for malware to be transported.</p>
