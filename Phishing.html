  <h2>What Is It?</h2>

  <p class="quote">
  According to the dictionary, phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.
  </p>

  <p>Email is a popular form of communication where users can send information to each other. But not all users are who you think they are. The Nigerian prince that promises he will give you 10 million dollars for a simple donation is most likely a phishing account. Hackers are very developed socially, and can easily manipulate users into believing that they are a trusted business. Using this they can obtain information such as passwords, bank account numbers, social security numbers, etc. Remember to stay cautious with all emails and messages.

  <h2>Specifics</h2>

  <p class="quote">
This section will cover the three types of phishing: deceptive, spear, and pharming</p>

  <p>Deceptive phishing is the most common type of phishing. Beware of fake companies such as AppIe and Gooogle, which are two phishing accounts that trick users into believing that they need to "recover their account" and make the user go to their fake website. The website is really realistic and many users believe that this is the true site. They plug in their information and don't realize that they presented their log in to a hacker. If you ever recive any suspicious email, check the greeting. If the email starts with Dear Customer or something generic, understand that this can be a potential scammer.  </p> </p>

  <p>Spear phishing is more dangerous. It is similar to deceptive phishing, but targets a specific individual. They can start off by going Dear John Doe, or use any specific information. The hacker can use their phone number or address to convey that they know the user. The best way to prevent this is to check for spelling errors or grammer issues. Companies already incorperate employee security awareness programs to keep information from being spread.</p>

  <p>Pharming is a form of phishing where the scamming doesn't occur via email. In fact, the user is redirected from a website to an infected website. They can plug in credit card information, addresses, and phone numbers into what they believe is a payment screen. Hackers obtain these domains by hijacking the websites, which mainly belong to small companies. If you notice a difference in the website while paying, check the domain to see if you have been redirected to a pharming website. </p>
